# Dogbot ROS Components

DogBot comes integrated with [ROS] for ease of integration with your own systems.  Refer to the main repo [instructions](../README.md) for initial setup.

Currently the [URDF] and a simple Gazebo world are available for Dogbot v4.

# ROS/Gazebo operation

There is a standard [Catkin] workspace in the ROS folder, which should be built with `catkin build` starting in this folder (/ROS):

```bat
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```

It is assumed that you have ROS and Catkin installed; ROS install instructions are [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation).

## View Gazebo Simulation

To view the DogBot sim in an empty Gazebo world, starting with physics paused:
```bat
roslaunch dogbot_gazebo gztest.launch paused:=true
```

## View in RViz

To view the DogBot sim in RViz:

```bat
roslaunch dogbot_control dogbot_display.launch
```

## Operation and Controllers

12 controllers are instantiated, e.g. *front_right_knee_joint_controller*.  The [ros_control](http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager) package is used to spawn and interact with ROS controllers.

## Control via Topics, examples

Show the current joint states: `rostopic echo -n 1 /dogbot/joint_states`

# URDF Standalone

The urdf and meshes to use outside of ROS or Gazebo are all under [dogbot_description](src/dogbot_description).  You should be able to use the URDF without building and sourcing the Catkin workspace, but note that the [dogbot.urdf](src/dogbot_description/urdf/dogbot.urdf) file defines the location of the meshes via the dogbot_description package location.

**Note:** Some of the values in the URDF are estimates, as the design is still undergoing refinements.  Overall weight will also vary according to individual DogBot specification (e.g. on-board compute resources, battery configuration).

URDF rendered in a DART simulation:

## Export URDF/SDF from Xacro

The xacro file is the golden source of DogBot's URDF definition.  The xacro file can be transformed to URDF or SDF using the following (note, [ROS] is required for this step):
```bat
cd src/dogbot_description/urdf
rosrun xacro xacro -o dogbot.urdf  dogbot.xacro
gz sdf -p dogbot.urdf  > dogbot.sdf
```
